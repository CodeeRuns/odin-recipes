        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This is an easy weeknight dish that is quick to throw together and promises to be a hit. Once it has been baked, the spaghetti casserole can be sliced into neat squares, and the layer of ricootta and parmesan filling give it the rich flavours as that of lasagna. You can play around with the recipe for substituting the meat with another, such as Italian sausage or ground turkey, to suit any potential picky eaters.</p>
        <p>If you are planning on making this dish in advance, you can assemble the casserole (up until step 5) and then store covered in the refrigerator, until ready to bake. Serve with a side of fresh garden salad to cut through some of the richness of the dish</p>
